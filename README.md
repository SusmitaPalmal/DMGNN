This code is for implemetation of breast cancer prognosis prediction considering dynamic features. 
To run the given code, the system should have a minimum of a 2-core Intel Xeon or equivalent processor, at least 12 GB of RAM, and an NVIDIA GPU such as T4, P100, or V100 with 16 GB of VRAM. The required software environment includes Python 3.10 or later and PyTorch version 2.0.1 with CUDA 11.8 support, along with torchvision 0.15.2 and torchaudio 2.0.2. Additional libraries needed include torch-scatter, torch-sparse, torch-cluster, and torch-spline-conv, all compatible with PyTorch 2.0.1 and CUDA 11.8, as well as torch-geometric. The NumPy version should be 1.23.5, and optional visualization tools like matplotlib and seaborn may be used for plotting feature importance. The setup also requires access to data files, utility scripts such as `seed.py` and `utils.py`, and a writable path to store result outputs.
